		<name>Confidential Mission</name>
		<desc>A group of terrorists have stolen the World's Collisions satellite. CMF sends two of its agents, Howard Gibson and Jean Clifford, to investigate. They first infiltrate a museum, where they find out that the "Agares" group is behind the plot. As soon as they grab the disc with the information, one of the Agares leaders prevent them from getting the disc. After they retrieve the disc, they are sent to a train traveling through the mountains. Irina Mikalova, the satellite programmer, has been kidnapped by Agares and forced to reprogram the satellite.

Howard and Jean manage to rescue Irina but are stopped by the General, who is defeated by the two agents. With the help of Irina, CMF locates Agares Headquarters, where the satellite control is being transported to a submarine. Howard and Jean manage to make it through the base and find the Agares Leader, who plans to use the satellite to destroy the CMF Headquarters.

After being defeated, the leader uses a self-destruct sequence to defeat the two agents and escapes with the satellite data, but the agents manage to use the satellite to destroy the submarine and the leader. The two agents escape, and CMF is saved.</desc>
