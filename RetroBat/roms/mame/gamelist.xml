Egg Venture (c) 1997 The Game Room.

A 'kid-friendly' animated shoot'em up game. Players use an optical gun to shoot at the 'bad eggs' while avoiding shooting the 'good guy eggs'. Players advance stage by stage to 38 different levels by shooting a certain number of targets.

- TRIVIA -

Egg Venture was a joint project between arcade parts company 'The Game Room' and 'ICE' (Innovative Creations in Entertainment), each of whom released their own version. The game was programmed by Kyle Hodgetts and does have several minor glitches, mainly down to the nature of the hardware. Problems with the availability of components meant that Kyle was forced to duplicate the sound system three times on the board to achieve polyphony, rather than using a simpler, but more expensive YM/OKI combination. 

Egg Venture does not have an ending and it's only scoring system is the printing of the Dynamic Play Adjustment skill ranking after every 'day'.

The game appears to use (in places) the bass line from 'The Great Egg Race' by Martin Cooke and Richard Denton of BBC Records, although this is apparently a legitimate use, as the music came from a royalty-free library disc.

Following the success of Egg Venture, or more likely to fix the bugs present, a 'Deluxe version' was made.

The Egg Venture characters were later used in a kids redemption game.

		<name>Revolution X</name>
		<desc>A first-person shooter featuring the multi-platinum selling rock band Aerosmith.

It's 1996 and the US have been taken over by the New Order Nation. The group, led by their commander Mistress Helga, have declared war on youth culture, banning music, TV and video games in the process. Meanwhile at a gig in Los Angeles, members of Aerosmith are captured by the NON. With a machine gun in your hand and the strongest weapon of them all, music, it is your task to end the regime of the New Order Nation and free the Aerosmith members.

Remember... MUSIC IS THE WEAPON!</desc>

		<name>Chiller</name>
		<desc>This is a gun game, and there are four different screens (plus two different bonus screens). The object is simply to shoot everything in sight (and to try and locate any hidden targets on the screen). The game is based on time, and the timer moves faster when you are shooting poorly.
The first screen is a torture chamber. There are four (still living) human targets on this screen. From left to right they are; a man chained to the wall, a person in a guillotine (shoot the top of the guillotine to decapitate them), a woman strapped in a strange machine, and a man in a head vise (shoot the vise to crush his head). The rest of the room is strewn with blood and loose body parts. You don't simply shoot each target once, instead you shoot each part of the target, which reduces that part to a mess of blood and bones. This is thankfully the most disturbing level in the game.
The second room is another torture chamber with a river of blood flowing through the middle. This one has five human targets; a man strapped to a board, a man chained to the floor, two people on stretching racks (shoot the wheels to pull them apart), and a woman hung from rope over the river (shoot a pulley to slowly lower her into the river to be eaten by crocodiles). Body parts will flow down the river randomly, and a man will pop out of a door from time to time to toss a blade into one of the helpless victims.
The third level is a haunted house hallway. There is only one human victim on this level. It is a woman who runs from one doorway to another, shoot out the trapdoor to cause her to fall inside (and then shoot the beast that was chasing her). Your other targets are mostly assorted ghosts, and a few random body parts that will fall from the ceiling.
The final level is a graveyard. Your only human victim on this level is a woman who is half buried in the ground, shooting her torso multiple times strips off her clothing until she is topless, and the last shot kills her. You other targets are bats, hands that pop up from the ground, and a man who pulls a cart full of body parts (you can't kill him, shooting him just makes him run away, only to return later).

The game repeats the levels over and over again until you manage to find every secret target on each screen (it gives you hints between the levels). Finding all the targets on a single screen earns you a bonus game (a slot machine), while finding all the hidden targets in the game gives you the second bonus game (a shooting gallery), and a free game.</desc>

		<name>Crossbow</name>
		<desc>Early first-person shoot'em up game with a dungeons and dragons feel about it. Features good speech and screams.

Gameplay requires the player to protect a band of adventurers (referred to as "friends" by the game) from afar by shooting objects that threaten them. The adventurers enter from the left-hand side of the screen and attempt to cross the screen unharmed. If the player helps them reach the opposite side of the screen safely, the adventurers survive to the next scenario, and new adventurers are occasionally granted between scenarios. In addition to the obstacles, the adventurers are vulnerable to the player's shots. The first time the player shoots an adventurer, an on-screen message is shown: "DON'T SHOOT YOUR FRIENDS!" Thereafter, shooting an adventurer will cause him/her to emit a cry of pain, and to walk at a slower pace the rest of the way. A second shot will kill the adventurer.Scenarios are chosen by shooting a destination on a map screen, which include: town, desert, volcano, cave, bridge, jungle, and castle.

The short path to reach the castle is by using the following Color paths -&gt;  Green -&gt; Blue -&gt; Blue -&gt; Red.

The goal is to reach the final scenario, past the castle, in which the player confronts the Masterâ€”who presumably created the dangers in the game. Defeating the Master of Darkness requires shooting him in the eyes when they turn red (and deadly). The player is treated to a brief congratulation and a challenge to defeat the Master again, but if you dare. Following this screen the player starts over with however many adventurers survived the confrontation.</desc>

		<desc>Rail Chase is a lightgun controlled one or two player shooting game, in which the players travel in a minecart through a huge rail network; pursued by a multitude of weapon-carrying enemies. The fast-paced action also features sections in which the player comes across junctions in the track and can chose whether to go left or right - the chosen route usually dictating how many tack obstacles and enemies the player must face - this is achieved by shooting the signposts that are situated in the middle of the points. Some sections also have the player's minecart leave the track entirely and travel over open ground.</desc>

Jurassic Park features Sega's often-used and highly effective sprite scaled graphics and is very similar in style to another Sega Lightgun shoot-em-up, 1991's "Rail Chase". For subsequent games in the series, graphics technology had moved on somewhat and scaled sprites were dropped in favour of far superior textured polygons.</desc>

		<name>Golgo 13</name>
		<desc>A lightgun game in which the player, armed with a semi-automatic sniper rifle takes on the role of the world's most lethal and highly paid assassin, Duke Togo: Codename Golgo 13. Unlike other lightgun games Golgo 13 is very story driven and combines both 3-D and 2-D graphic elements.

The player starts their career with a 100 percent accuracy rating and takes on various assignments. Each assignment begins with a 2D comic book storyline and although in Japanese they should still give the player some idea of the background story. The objective of the chosen assignment is then displayed together with the time limit, target zone, and available ammunition.

At the end of each assignment the player is treated to on screen display of their performance. For each assignment successfully completed a large sum of cash is added to the playerâ€™s total, plus an extra sum is awarded for hitting the target zone. If however the player fails to complete the objective or the timer reaches zero, the playerâ€™s accuracy rating is reduced and the player is then moved on to choose the next assignment. The game is over when the playerâ€™s accuracy rating reaches zero.

At the start of the playerâ€™s career, 5 different assignments are available to choose from and can be completed in any order. Once all 5 assignments have been undertaken a new round of assignments becomes available. In total there are 4 rounds each consisting of 5 assignments, with each round becoming progressively harder. The last round includes a special stage which can only be selected after all the assignments have been completed. Upon completion of the special stage the credits roll and the game ends. The player is then once again returned to the start of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Operation Wolf is a light-gun controlled shoot-em-up in which the player takes on the role of Special Forces operative 'Roy Adams' and must infiltrate and capture six heavily fortified bases, with the ultimate aim of rescuing five trapped hostages and guiding them to safety.

In order to complete each stage, the player must shoot as many enemy soldiers and vehicles as that stage requires. Enemy soldiers can throw hand grenades and knives, while enemy vehicles can shoot missiles and launch rockets. The player's ammunition and grenades are limited, but can be stocked up by shooting barrels and crates. Occasionally a high-powered machine gun power-up appears, allowing the player's gun to have unlimited ammo and an increased rate of fire for 10 seconds. Completing the 'Powder Magazine' stage fills the player's ammunition and grenade supplies to maximum.</desc>

		<name>Lethal Enforcers II: Gun Fighters</name>
		<desc>Western style shooting game featuring digitized characters. The game consists of 5 stages: Bank Robbery, Stage Hold-Up, Saloon Showdown, Train Robbery, and Hide-Out. 

The player begins the game holding the rank of Sheriff, but if too many innocents or fellow lawmen are killed, the player can be demoted to Deputy or even Posse member. Complete a stage without killing any innocents, and the player is promoted to Deputy Marshal, further success can eventually lead to the player being promoted to the level of U.S. Marshal.

The player's gun can hold up to 6 bullets at a time. On each stage, there are special items that can be shot to reveal better weaponry, such as double rigs, rifles, 50 caliber sharps, shotguns, gatling guns and cannon. The gatling guns and cannon can only be used once but the double rigs, rifles, 50 caliber sharps and shotguns can be reloaded the same way as your regular 6-gun. Once a life is lost, any additional weapons are lost and the player is once again armed with only a 6-gun.</desc>

		<desc>Lethal Enforcers &amp;copy; 1992 Konami Company, Ltd

As an undercover police officer the player&amp;#039;s mission is to put a stop to an array of criminals ranging from bank robbers, hijackers and numerous other law breakers. As well as upholding the law, players must also try to protect innocent members of the public from the criminal gangs, being careful not to accidentally shoot them. Shooting innocent victims will result in the player&amp;#039;s energy level being severely reduced.

Lethal Enforcers is an on-the-rails light-gun game. The player is initially armed only with a standard issue revolver, but weapon upgrades such as a .357 Magnum, a shotgun and an automatic pistol can be collected by shooting at their on-screen counterparts as the game progresses. While some weapons can be reloaded, others can&amp;#039;t and are only useful for a limited time. Any weapon upgrades are lost in the event of a player losing a life.</desc>

		<desc>Point Blank is a challenging light gun game where players can select from a variety of target practice mini games.

Many games require skill and accuracy, such as shooting cardboard cutouts of criminals, a one-shot chance at hitting a leaf, aiming for a specific toy from a shelf, and shooting at objects that move across the screen or rush towards the player.

Your 'judgement' is based on your shooting accuracy in some games, and others require you to hit a certain number of targets within the given time.</desc>

		<desc>A superb, on-the-rails lightgun game in which the player takes on the role of a lone mercenary who must rescue the President's daughter, Rachel, from the clutches of the evil 'Sherudo' and his terrorist gang. The game takes the player into and around Sherudo's clifftop, castle hideout.

As the game's title suggests, time is one of the player's biggest enemies, as each area must be cleared within a strict time limit. Extra time is occasionally awarded, however, when some of the more powerful enemy soldiers are killed.

The game offers the player two different game modes: 
STORY MODE: the player must defeat all of the enemies on the level to proceed to the next level.
TIME ATTACK: the player selects one of four stages and must defeat all enemies in the time allowed. The player is given unlimited lives in this mode, but is constantly fighting against a very tight time limit.</desc>

Level 3: At end of level is elevator with zombies, after kill ALL elevator's zombies Red Crystal appear on screen.
Level 4: The Blue Crystal is hidden in a statuette on a pillar (the statuette resembles the level 2 famous head with the horns).
Level 5: The Green Crystal is obtained at the end of the level by killing the 2-heads monster.

To fight the final boss, the Crystal Codes seen on level 2 should be inserted: Red, Green, Blue - if not it is assured death.

In game are secret entrances where you will find special items:
1. At end of first graveyard is grave with your initials, behind this grave is tree and 'man with gun'. Shoot to this tree over 'man with gun' when screen move up. If you shot in right place on tree secret entrance will appear. In this secret entrance are items:
