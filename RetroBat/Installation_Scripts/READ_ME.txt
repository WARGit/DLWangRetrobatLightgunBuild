MoveRomsFromSource.bat - This script separates the roms from the source files.

Copy it into the root of the retrobat folder (where retrobat.exe is) and run it

provide a folder path for the content to be copied to (Recommended to use a path with no spaces, e.g V:\Out. NOT TESTED OTHERWISE.)

The script will move all roms/bios files ect. out of the source ready for upload back to github with changes.
