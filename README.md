This is an all-in-one lightgun build based on Retrobat/Emulation Station targeting Windows and Gun4IR.

The aim is to preconfigure all games, emulators and provide an easy installation script such that this entire build is as close to plug and play as can be.

Feel free to fork / branch / PR / Raise Issues as you see fit, the more help we get, the more testing that is carried out then the better this will become.
